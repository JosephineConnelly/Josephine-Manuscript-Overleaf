  abstract = {Belgian agriculture could decrease its heavy dependency on imported protein crops by a local production of soybean. Unfortunately, soybean production is hampered by Belgium's short and cold growing season. We evaluated 409 varieties, breeding lines and genebank accessions planted at two planting dates in a row-plot experiment to explore the genotypes that are suitable for growing in Belgium. The current MG000 varieties may require additional crossings with very early-maturing genotypes to guarantee an optimal and safe harvest. Within such crossings, care must be taken to maintain the indeterminate or semi-determinate growth habit. Vegetative development was negatively correlated with flowering date and maturity date, but positively correlated with cold tolerance. Seed quality was mainly affected by mould infection (associated with strong lodging and late maturity) and mottling caused by soybean mosaic virus. Planting 3 weeks earlier resulted in 8~d earlier flowering and 7~d earlier maturing, without significant losses in seed yield per plant. The results of this row-plot experiment hold promise to select for genotypes adapted to the Belgian conditions.},

The flowering duration comprised two distinct phases: a photoperiod-sensitive phase beginning at first flowering, and a subsequent photoperiod-insensitive phase. The duration of the photoperiod-sensitive phase varied much more among the isolines in LH) than in SD. Only the dominant allele E-1 increased the sensitivity of the photoperiod-sensitive phase of flowering duration to photoperiod singly, but positive epistatic effects were detected between E-1 and E-2, E-1 and E-3, and especially among all three dominant alleles. The increases in flowering duration resulting from the combined effects of gene and environment (i.e. photoperiod) were associated with considerable increases in biomass and seed yield at harvest maturity.

  abstract = {Unisexual vertebrates typically form through hybridization events between sexual species in which reproductive mode transitions occur in the hybrid offspring. This evolutionary history is thought to have important consequences for the ecology of unisexual lineages and their interactions with congeners in natural communities. However, these consequences have proven challenging to study owing to uncertainty about patterns of population genetic diversity in unisexual lineages. Of particular interest is resolving the contribution of historical hybridization events versus post formational mutation to patterns of genetic diversity in nature. Here we use restriction site associated DNA genotyping to evaluate genetic diversity and demographic history in Aspidoscelis laredoensis, a diploid unisexual lizard species from the vicinity of the Rio Grande River in southern Texas and northern Mexico. The sexual progenitor species from which one or more lineages are derived also occur in the Rio Grande Valley region, although patterns of distribution across individual sites are quite variable. Results from population genetic and phylogenetic analyses resolved the major axes of genetic variation in this species and highlight how these match predictions based on historical patterns of hybridization. We also found discordance between results of demographic modelling using different statistical approaches with the genomic data. We discuss these insights within the context of the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that generate and maintain lineage diversity in unisexual species. As one of the most dynamic, intriguing, and geographically well investigated groups of whiptail lizards, these species hold substantial promise for future studies on the constraints of diversification in unisexual vertebrates.},

  abstract = {The estimation of linkage disequilibrium between molecular markers within a population is critical when establishing the minimum number of markers required for association studies, genomic selection, and inferring historical events influencing different populations. This work aimed to evaluate the extent and decay of linkage disequilibrium in a coho salmon breeding population using a high-density SNP array. Linkage disequilibrium was estimated between a total of 93,502 SNPs found in 64 individuals (33 dams and 31 sires) from the breeding population. The markers encompass all 30 coho salmon chromosomes and comprise 1,684.62~Mb of the genome. The average density of markers per chromosome ranged from 48.31 to 66 per 1~Mb. The minor allele frequency averaged 0.26 (with a range from 0.22 to 0.27). The overall average linkage disequilibrium among SNPs pairs measured as r2 was 0.10. The Average r2 value decreased with increasing physical distance, with values ranging from 0.21 to 0.07 at a distance lower than 1~kb and up to 10~Mb, respectively. An r2 threshold of 0.2 was reached at distance of approximately 40 Kb. Chromosomes Okis05, Okis15 and Okis28 showed high levels of linkage disequilibrium ({$>$}0.20 at distances lower than 1~Mb). Average r2 values were lower than 0.15 for all chromosomes at distances greater than 4~Mb. An effective population size of 43 was estimated for the population 10 generations ago, and 325, for 139 generations ago. Based on the effective number of chromosome segments, we suggest that at least 74,000 SNPs would be necessary for an association mapping study and genomic predictions. Therefore, the SNP panel used allowed us to capture high-resolution information in the farmed coho salmon population. Furthermore, based on the contemporary Ne, a new mate allocation strategy is suggested to increase the effective population size.},

  abstract = {High-density genomic data is often analyzed by combining information over windows of adjacent markers. Interpretation of data grouped in windows versus at individual locations may increase statistical power, simplify computation, reduce sampling noise, and reduce the total number of tests performed. However, use of adjacent marker information can result in over- or under-smoothing, undesirable window boundary specifications, or highly correlated test statistics. We introduce a method for defining windows based on statistically guided breakpoints in the data, as a foundation for the analysis of multiple adjacent data points. This method involves first fitting a cubic smoothing spline to the data and then identifying the inflection points of the fitted spline, which serve as the boundaries of adjacent windows. This technique does not require prior knowledge of linkage disequilibrium, and therefore can be applied to data collected from individual or pooled sequencing experiments. Moreover, in contrast to existing methods, an arbitrary choice of window size is not necessary, since these are determined empirically and allowed to vary along the genome.},

  abstract = {Association mapping panels represent foundational resources for understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic diversity and serve to advance plant breeding by exploring genetic variation across diverse accessions. We report the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of 400 sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) accessions from the Sorghum Association Panel (SAP) at an average coverage of 38\texttimes{} (25\textendash 72\texttimes ), enabling the development of a high-density genomic marker set of 43 983 694 variants including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (approximately 38 million), insertions/deletions (indels) (approximately 5 million), and copy number variants (CNVs) (approximately 170 000). We observe slightly more deletions among indels and a much higher prevalence of deletions among CNVs compared to insertions. This new marker set enabled the identification of several novel putative genomic associations for plant height and tannin content, which were not identified when using previous lower-density marker sets. WGS identified and scored variants in 5-kb bins where available genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) data captured no variants, with half of all bins in the genome falling into this category. The predictive ability of genomic best unbiased linear predictor (GBLUP) models was increased by an average of 30\% by using WGS markers rather than GBS markers. We identified 18 selection peaks across subpopulations that formed due to evolutionary divergence during domestication, and we found six Fst peaks resulting from comparisons between converted lines and breeding lines within the SAP that were distinct from the peaks associated with historic selection. This population has served and continues to serve as a significant public resource for sorghum research and demonstrates the value of improving upon existing genomic resources.},

  abstract = {Plant breeding can be broadly defined as alterations caused in plants as a result of their use by humans, ranging from unintentional changes resulting from the advent of agriculture to the application of molecular tools for precision breeding. The vast diversity of breeding methods can be simplified into three categories: (i) plant breeding based on observed variation by selection of plants based on natural variants appearing in nature or within traditional varieties; (ii) plant breeding based on controlled mating by selection of plants presenting recombination of desirable genes from different parents; and (iii) plant breeding based on monitored recombination by selection of specific genes or marker profiles, using molecular tools for tracking within-genome variation. The continuous application of traditional breeding methods in a given species could lead to the narrowing of the gene pool from which cultivars are drawn, rendering crops vulnerable to biotic and abiotic stresses and hampering future progress. Several methods have been devised for introducing exotic variation into elite germplasm without undesirable effects. Cases in rice are given to illustrate the potential and limitations of different breeding approaches.},

  abstract = {It is the purpose of this paper to illustrate the impact of geography, climate, and humankind in shaping the present-day genetic diversity in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. Examination of soybean germplasm collections around the globe reveals that an enormous phenotypic range in genetic traits exists in soybean, which is well beyond the phenotypic range observed in the wild progenitor (Glycine soja Seib. et Zucc.). Maturity date, seed coat color, plant height, seed size, and seed yield are noted examples of traits which have a wider phenotypic range in G. max than in the wild G. soja. The diversity found in domesticated soybean is the result of over 3,000 years of cultivation in which Chinese farmers selected more than 20,000 landraces (defined as cultivars that predate scientific breeding). The extensive range in phenotype embodied in landraces today is the result of the slow spread of soybean throughout geographically diverse Asia (China first, then Korea and Japan), the continual occurrence of natural mutations in the crop, and both conscious and unconscious selection for local adaptation. The more recent spread of soybean out of Asia in the past 250 years, coupled with modern breeding efforts of the past 70, has intensified and globalized the process of local adaptation and increased the phenotypic range in soybean beyond that of landraces. The increased range in phenotype for modern cultivars includes increases in seed yield, elevation of seed protein/oil concentration, and development, only within the past 20 years, of commercial cultivars that are sufficiently tall and adapted to be grown profitably near the equator. The phenotypic range and distribution observed in modern cultivars and antecedent landraces have clear biogeographical interpretations which relate primarily to genetic alteration of photoperiod response (a prerequisite to adaptation to diverse latitudes) and tolerance to climate extremes.},

  abstract = {Soybean is an important cash crop with unique and important traits such as the high seed protein and oil contents, and the ability to perform symbiotic nitrogen fixation. A reference genome of cultivated soybeans was established in 2010, followed by whole-genome re-sequencing of wild and cultivated soybean accessions. These efforts revealed unique features of the soybean genome and helped to understand its evolution. Mapping of variations between wild and cultivated soybean genomes were performed. These genomic variations may be related to the process of domestication and human selection. Wild soybean germplasms exhibited high genomic diversity and hence may be an important source of novel genes/alleles. Accumulation of genomic data will help to refine genetic maps and expedite the identification of functional genes. In this review, we summarize the major findings from the whole-genome sequencing projects and discuss the possible impacts on soybean researches and breeding programs. Some emerging areas such as transcriptomic and epigenomic studies will be introduced. In addition, we also tabulated some useful bioinformatics tools that will help the mining of the soybean genomic data.},

  abstract = {Maize is a globally valuable commodity and one of the most extensively studied genetic model organisms. However, we know surprisingly little about the extent and potential utility of the genetic variation found in wild relatives of maize. Here, we characterize a high-density genomic variation map from 744 genomes encompassing maize and all wild taxa of the genus Zea, identifying over 70 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The variation map reveals evidence of selection within taxa displaying novel adaptations. We focus on adaptive alleles in highland teosinte and temperate maize, highlighting the key role of flowering-time-related pathways in their adaptation. To show the utility of variants in these data, we generate mutant alleles for two flowering-time candidate genes. This work provides an extensive sampling of the genetic diversity of Zea, resolving questions on evolution and identifying adaptive variants for direct use in modern breeding.},

  abstract = {While photoperiod responses have been studied in soybean [Glycine mar (L.) Merr.] isolines, identification of temperature and photothermal responses are lacking in early-maturing soybean. This study was conducted to quantify photoperiod and temperature responses of early-maturing soybean. Six 'Harosoy' isolines with different combinations of alleles at the E1, E3, E4, and E7 loci were grown in growth cabinets with 10-, 12-, 14-, 16-, and 20-h photoperiods and with either 18 or 28 degreesC constant temperature. Under the most inductive conditions (10 and 12 h, 28 degreesC, all isolines flowered in about 26 d. Under the least inductive conditions (20 h, 28 degreesC, there was a 50 d difference in flowering time between the early- and late-flowering isolines. Interestingly, the late-flowering isolines flowered earlier under cool than under warm temperatures. A mathematical model was developed to quantify the effects of temperature and photoperiod on days to first flower. This model related the rate of phenological development from planting to flowering to temperature, photoperiod and the interaction between temperature and photoperiod. The equation was integrated analytically, resulting in an inverse time (1/time) equation, or numerically resulting in the development of a Growing Photothermal Day (G(PTD)) similar to a heat unit. The model had a base temperature (5.8 degreesC below which the rate of phenological development was zero, a critical or base photoperiod (13.5 h) below which photoperiod had no effect, and two genetic coefficients, one of which varied with isoline. The isoline photoperiod sensitivity coefficient was linearly related to the number of dominant (late flowering, photoperiod sensitive) alleles. The model fit the observed data well (R-2 = 0.96).},

  abstract = {Cold temperatures during early reproductive development may result in reduced pod and seed formation in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. The objectives of this work were to quantify cold tolerance of six potential parents, to screen breeding populations for cold tolerance, to search for associations between molecular markers and cold tolerance phenotypes, and to evaluate field performance of breeding lines. Six cultivars were evaluated for pod and seed set after exposure to 0 to 6 wk cold periods (15/5\textdegree C day/night), which began at flowering in growth cabinets. Evaluation at 6 vs. 2 wk following the end of a 3 or 6 wk cold period best discriminated between cold tolerant (CT) and cold sensitive (CS) cultivars. Two recombinant inbred line populations were cold stressed in growth cabinets with divergent selection performed over the F5 through F7 generations to select CT and CS lines. Bulked segregant analysis identified six chromosomal regions, four of which are related by homology, as potentially impacting the trait. Over 8 yr in the field at Ottawa, Canada, CT lines yielded 379 kg ha-1 more but matured 5.5 d later than CS lines without visual symptoms of cold damage. Following selection for early maturity, random lines from an additional four populations developed from a selected CT and CS line each crossed to another CT and CS parent were field tested in three environments. Cold tolerant \texttimes{} CT lines yielded about 8\% more than CS \texttimes{} CS lines, again without visual cold damage symptoms.},

  abstract = {Summary: The variant call format (VCF) is a generic format for storing DNA polymorphism data such as SNPs, insertions, deletions and structural variants, together with rich annotations. VCF is usually stored in a compressed manner and can be indexed for fast data retrieval of variants from a range of positions on the reference genome. The format was developed for the 1000 Genomes Project, and has also been adopted by other projects such as UK10K, dbSNP and the NHLBI Exome Project. VCFtools is a software suite that implements various utilities for processing VCF files, including validation, merging, comparing and also provides a general Perl API.Availability: ~http://vcftools.sourceforge.netContact: ~rd@sanger.ac.uk},

  abstract = {The European Union has a high demand for plant proteins for food and feed. Its self-sufficiency rate is about 5\% for soya crude proteins. The European Union and its Member States have launched initiatives for reducing soya imports that come mainly from South America and promoting domestic production of protein-rich crops. In the future, climate suitability for soybean cultivation is likely to increase in oceanic and continental Europe. The recent AE2050 study (; ) concluded that, in some parts of Europe (defined here as the European Union-27 plus other Balkan countries, Switzerland, Norway and the United Kingdom), cropland requirements in 2050 may be lower than ``2010'' cropland areas given possible changes in European food demand (related to glooming demographic growth and under the assumption of healthy diets) and in crop yields (influenced by technological developments and climate change). In this study, we examine to what extent this ``cropland surplus'' could be used to increase soybean production in Europe and reduce the dependency ratio on protein imports. Only in the case of a Healthy Diets scenario (less meat consumption, inducing less animals fed with cakes), substantial soybean acreages could be envisaged to reduce the European reliance on imports. In addition to the surplus allowed by increasing yields, land surplus was also made available by the reduction of livestock production and its grain feed requirements. The best-case scenario, combining healthy diets and trend-based yield growth, would reduce European imports to only 15\% of its total domestic requirements \emph{versus{$<$}i/{$>$} 45\% for the Trend-based Diets scenario. This can be compared to a dependency rate of 51\% in our base year ``2010'', and of 53\%\textendash 54\% for the two 2050 scenarios without growing soybean on cropland surplus. If the range of these quite optimistic estimations of surplus land dedicated to soybean was reduced to more plausible levels (limited to 10\% of annual field cropland in 2050) and considering current soybean yield levels (``2019'' instead of ``2010''), the decrease in Europe's oil cake imports levels would be lower. However, its dependency rate could still be reduced from 54\% to 46\% in the Trend-based Diets scenario, and from 53\% to 38\% in the Healthy Diets scenario. One important conclusion is that adopting healthy diets would allow a significant reduction of imports of soybean cakes from abroad with expected environmental benefits in Europe and overseas. On the supply side, challenges for a higher self-sufficiency rate of proteins in Europe resulting from the development of soybean domestic production will come from both available and suitable crop areas, attainable yields and relative profitability.}},

Bean curd (tofu) was prepared from the soymilk using calcium sulfate as a coagulant. Hardness of the beans, soaked beans and tofu was evaluated by means of an Instron Universal Testing Machine. Protein, oil, sugars, phosphorus, potassium and magnesium content was higher in the soymilks (d.b.) than in the original beans while calcium content was lower. Loss of solids from the beans during soaking was related to amount of water absorbed. Fatty acid analysis of the extracted fat revealed that 18:3 was negatively correlated with 18:1. All soybeans produced tofu of good texture. Composition of soymilk containing 6.25\% total solids was compared with that of bovine and human milk. Soymilk was low in fat and mono to tetra saccharides but contained large amounts of carbohydrates of higher molecular weight probably consisting of pectin and gums.

  abstract = {Soybean is a crop in high demand, in particular as a crucial source of plant protein. As a short-day plant, soybean is sensitive to the latitude of the growing site. Consequently, varieties that are well adapted to higher latitudes are required to expand the cultivation. In this study, we employed 50 soybean genotypes to perform a multi-location trial at seven locations across Germany in 2021. Two environmental target regions were determined following the latitude of the locations. Adaptation and trait stability of seed yield and protein content across all locations were evaluated using Genotype plus Genotype-by-Environment (GGE) biplots and Shukla's stability variance. We found a moderate level of crossing-over type genotype-by-location interaction across all locations. Within the environmental target regions, the genotype-by-location interaction could be minimised. Despite the positive correlation (R = 0.59) of seed yield between the environmental target regions and the same best-performing genotype, the genotype rankings differed in part substantially. In conclusion, we found that soybean can be grown at a wide range of latitudes across Germany. However, the performance of genotypes differed between the northern and southern locations, with an 18.8\% higher mean yield in the south. This in combination with the observed rank changes of high-performing genotypes between both environmental target regions suggests that selection targeted towards environments in northern Germany could improve soybean breeding for those higher latitude regions.},

The combination of biosystematic data and an extensive germplasm collection has provided a strong foundation for molecular systematic studies in the group, including those on allopolyploids. These studies have shown that the various polyploid taxa known from the subgenus are all part of a single large allopolyploid complex, linked by shared diploid genomes. Many elements of the complex have arisen recently, and most show evidence of recurrent origins. However, there are also many dissimilarities among even closely related polyploids. Polyploids differ from one another in such ways as number of origins, amount of allelic diversity harboured at different loci, bidirectional vs. unidirectional origins, retention of ribosomal gene homoeologues, success as measured by geographical range and abundance, and patterns of gene expression.},

  abstract = {In population genomics studies, accounting for the neutral covariance structure across population allele frequencies is critical to improve the robustness of genome-wide scan approaches. Elaborating on the BayEnv model, this study investigates several modeling extensions (i) to improve the estimation accuracy of the population covariance matrix and all the related measures, (ii) to identify significantly overly differentiated SNPs based on a calibration procedure of the XtX statistics, and (iii) to consider alternative covariate models for analyses of association with population-specific covariables. In particular, the auxiliary variable model allows one to deal with multiple testing issues and, providing the relative marker positions are available, to capture some linkage disequilibrium information. A comprehensive simulation study was carried out to evaluate the performances of these different models. Also, when compared in terms of power, robustness, and computational efficiency to five other state-of-the-art genome-scan methods (BayEnv2, BayScEnv, BayScan, flk, and lfmm), the proposed approaches proved highly effective. For illustration purposes, genotyping data on 18 French cattle breeds were analyzed, leading to the identification of 13 strong signatures of selection. Among these, four (surrounding the KITLG, KIT, EDN3, and ALB genes) contained SNPs strongly associated with the piebald coloration pattern while a fifth (surrounding PLAG1) could be associated to morphological differences across the populations. Finally, analysis of Pool-Seq data from 12 populations of Littorina saxatilis living in two different ecotypes illustrates how the proposed framework might help in addressing relevant ecological issues in nonmodel species. Overall, the proposed methods define a robust Bayesian framework to characterize adaptive genetic differentiation across populations. The BayPass program implementing the different models is available at http://www1.montpellier.inra.fr/CBGP/software/baypass/.},

  abstract = {A negative consequence of four decades of modern soybean breeding is the evolution of cultivars with complex pedigrees that tend to obscure the genetic base of applied breeding. A result is that the genetic base of North American soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] has never been described fully. We attempt here to define the genetic base as sets of genotypes that contain 99\% of the genes found in modern cultivars. For clarity, the base is defined both in terms of the original plant introductions (ancestors) used for hybridization and in terms of the progeny derived from them. In a first analysis of pedigree data, 80 ancestors were identified and their fractional genetic contributions to 258 cultivars were computed using coefficient of parentage (r) estimates. In a second analysis, six breeding lines and 133 cultivars were identified as first progeny of the 80 ancestors, and their contributions as parents to modern cultivars were computed using r. This analysis revealed that 91 first progeny constituted 99\% of the genes found in modern cultivars. Lincoln and Harosoy in the North and Lee and its full sib (D49-2491) in the South contributed nearly 40\% of the genes to North American cultivars. Nearly 75\% of the genes in modern cultivars trace to 17 first progeny released before 1960, indicating that breeders have remained dependent upon this early genetic core of breeding material. For practical study of the genetic base of North American soybean, we propose using a combination of the results from the two analyses described here. Twenty-eight ancestors and seven first progeny were identified which contribute 95\% of the genes found in modern soybean cultivars. This group of 35 genotypes would be a useful core collection for evaluating the presence, absence, or distribution of a trait in North American soybean cultivars.},

  abstract = {The genetic relatedness of North American soybean [Glycine max (L.) (Merr.)] may threaten long-term breeding progress. To alleviate this problem, we propose that breeders diversify applied programs by capitalizing upon genetic patterns that may exist in cultivated germplasm. To date, only one diversity pattern, the well-known North-South distinction, is explained in applied breeding. Our objective was to identify and quantify additional factors influencing diversity in 258 cultivars released by public agencies during 1945 to 1988. We theorized that maturity group effects (MG, as a hybridization restriction factor), location of breeding programs (BP, as a selection factor), and breeder intuition and success factors beyond MG and BP may all influence the soybean cultivar diversity patterns. The patterns of diversity associated with the first two factors, MG and BP, were examined by quantifying average coefficient of parentage (r) within and between MG and BP. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) was applied to the r matrix to produce coordinates for pictorial depiction of MG and BP. To examine the third factor, breeder intuition and success, the MDS coordinates were also subjected to a nonhierarchical cluster analysis that revealed nine major clusters of soybean cultivars. A regression analysis was employed to determine the relative importance of North-South, MG, BP, and cluster patterns in explaining variation in the r matrix. The South-North distinction accounted for only 21\% of variability in cultivar relations indicating the presence of other major patterns of diversity. The MG, BP, and clusters independently explained 32, 42, and 57\% of the total variation in the cultivar pedigrees. Clusters most efficiently revealed patterns of diversity, and we propose the use of these clusters in the further study and management of soybean diversity. Multidimensional scaling coupled with nonhierarchical cluster analysis was a highly promising approach to the study of diversity.},

  abstract = {The postprandial rise in essential amino acid (EAA) concentrations modulates the increase in muscle protein synthesis rates after protein ingestion. The EAA content and AA composition of the dietary protein source contribute to the differential muscle protein synthetic response to the ingestion of different proteins. Lower EAA contents and specific lack of sufficient leucine, lysine, and/or methionine may be responsible for the lower anabolic capacity of plant-based compared with animal-based proteins. We compared EAA contents and AA composition of a large selection of plant-based protein sources with animal-based proteins and human skeletal muscle protein. AA composition of oat, lupin, wheat, hemp, microalgae, soy, brown rice, pea, corn, potato, milk, whey, caseinate, casein, egg, and human skeletal muscle protein were assessed using UPLC\textendash MS/MS. EAA contents of plant-based protein isolates such as oat (21\%), lupin (21\%), and wheat (22\%) were lower than animal-based proteins (whey 43\%, milk 39\%, casein 34\%, and egg 32\%) and muscle protein (38\%). AA profiles largely differed among plant-based proteins with leucine contents ranging from 5.1\% for hemp to 13.5\% for corn protein, compared to 9.0\% for milk, 7.0\% for egg, and 7.6\% for muscle protein. Methionine and lysine were typically lower in plant-based proteins (1.0\,{$\pm$}\,0.3 and 3.6\,{$\pm$}\,0.6\%) compared with animal-based proteins (2.5\,{$\pm$}\,0.1 and 7.0\,{$\pm$}\,0.6\%) and muscle protein (2.0 and 7.8\%, respectively). In conclusion, there are large differences in EAA contents and AA composition between various plant-based protein isolates. Combinations of various plant-based protein isolates or blends of animal and plant-based proteins can provide protein characteristics that closely reflect the typical characteristics of animal-based proteins.},

  abstract = {Comparing allele frequencies among populations that differ in environment has long been a tool for detecting loci involved in local adaptation. However, such analyses are complicated by an imperfect knowledge of population allele frequencies and neutral correlations of allele frequencies among populations due to shared population history and gene flow. Here we develop a set of methods to robustly test for unusual allele frequency patterns and correlations between environmental variables and allele frequencies while accounting for these complications based on a Bayesian model previously implemented in the software Bayenv. Using this model, we calculate a set of "standardized allele frequencies" that allows investigators to apply tests of their choice to multiple populations while accounting for sampling and covariance due to population history. We illustrate this first by showing that these standardized frequencies can be used to detect nonparametric correlations with environmental variables; these correlations are also less prone to spurious results due to outlier populations. We then demonstrate how these standardized allele frequencies can be used to construct a test to detect SNPs that deviate strongly from neutral population structure. This test is conceptually related to FST and is shown to be more powerful, as we account for population history. We also extend the model to next-generation sequencing of population pools-a cost-efficient way to estimate population allele frequencies, but one that introduces an additional level of sampling noise. The utility of these methods is demonstrated in simulations and by reanalyzing human SNP data from the Human Genome Diversity Panel populations and pooled next-generation sequencing data from Atlantic herring. An implementation of our method is available from http://gcbias.org.},

  abstract = {Present-day soybeans consist of elite cultivars and landraces (Glycine max, fully domesticated (FD)), annual wild type (Glycine soja, nondomesticated (ND)), and semi-wild type (semi-domesticated (SD)). FD soybean originated in China, although the details of its domestication history remain obscure. More than 500 diverse soybean accessions were sequenced using specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) to address fundamental questions regarding soybean domestication. In total, 64 141 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with minor allele frequencies (MAFs) {$>$} 0.05 were found among the 512 tested accessions. The results indicated that the SD group is not a hybrid between the FD and ND groups. The initial domestication region was pinpointed to central China (demarcated by the Great Wall to the north and the Qinling Mountains to the south). A total of 800 highly differentiated genetic regions and {$>$} 140 selective sweeps were identified, and these were three- and twofold more likely, respectively, to encompass a known quantitative trait locus (QTL) than the rest of the soybean genome. Forty-three potential quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs; including 15 distinct traits) were identified by genome-wide association mapping. The results of the present study should be beneficial for soybean improvement and provide insight into the genetic architecture of traits of agronomic importance.},

Genebanks provide genetic variation for the improvement of modern varieties, but the selection of suitable germplasm is frequently impeded by incomplete phenotypic data. We address this bottleneck by combining a Focused Identification of Germplasm Strategy (FIGS) with core collection methodology to select soybean (Glycine max) germplasm for Central European breeding from a collection of {$>$}17,000 accessions. By focussing on adaptation to high-latitude cold regions, we selected an ``environmental precore'' of 3,663 accessions using environmental data and compared the Donor opulation of Environments (DPE) in Asia and the Target Population of Environments (TPE) in Central Europe in the present and 2070. Using single nucleotide polymorphisms, we reduced the precore into two diverse core collections of 183 and 366 accessions to serve as diversity panels for evaluation in the TPE. Genetic differentiation between precore and non-precore accessions revealed genomic regions that control maturity, and novel candidate loci for environmental adaptation, demonstrating the potential of diversity panels for studying adaptation. Objective-driven core collections have the potential to increase germplasm utilization for abiotic adaptation by breeding for a rapidly changing climate, or de novo adaptation of crops to expand cultivation ranges.},

  abstract = {Understanding how crops adapt to specific environmental conditions is becoming increasingly important in the face of accelerating climate change, but the genetics of local adaptation remain little understood for many crops. Landscape genomics can reveal patterns of genetic variation that indicate adaptive diversification during crop evolution and dispersal. Here, we examine genetic differentiation and association signatures with environmental gradients in soybean (Glycine max) germplasm groups from China that were inferred from the USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection (N = 17,019 accessions) based on population structure and passport information. We recover genes previously known to be involved in soybean environmental adaptation and report numerous new candidate genes in selection signatures implicated by genomic resources such as the genome annotation and gene expression datasets to function in flowering regulation, photoperiodism and stress reaction cascades. Linkage disequilibrium network analysis suggested functional relationships between genomic regions with selection signatures, consistent with the polygenic nature of environmental adaptation. We tested whether haplotypes associated with environmental adaptation in China were present in 843 North American and 160 European soybean cultivars and found that haplotypes in major genes for early maturity have been selected during breeding, but also that a large number of haplotypes exhibiting putative adaptive variation for cold regions at high latitudes are underrepresented in modern cultivars. Our results demonstrate the value of landscape genomics analysis in genebank germplasm as a starting point for the study of crop environmental adaptation and have the potential to inform future research efforts focused on improved soybean adaptation. Functional validation of candidate genes will support understanding of their adaptive roles and likely enable the transfer of beneficial adaptive variation into modern breeding germplasm.},

With the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques and other potential genomic tools, these studies have become convenient too.

Many of these advanced methods have also been endorsed to unravel the origin trajectory of important crop species like\textemdash rice, citrus, peanut, olive, tea, etc. This chapter summarizes the various genomic tools and data analyses resources which are employed to dissect the complex genomes and underlying evolutionary steps as well as the paradigms of decoding domestication history of several crops.},

Population genetic studies have shown that synonymous sites are under weak selection and that codon bias is maintained by a balance between selection, mutation, and genetic drift. It appears that the major Cause for selection oil codon bias is that certain preferred colons are translated more accurately and/or efficiently. However, additional and sometimes may be even contradictory selective forces appear to affect colon usage as well. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of the ways ill which natural selection participates lit the creation and maintenance of codon bias. We also raise Several open questions: (i) IS natural selection weak independently of the level of codon bias? It is possible that selection for preferred Colons is weak only when colon bills approaches equilibrium and may be quite strong oil genes with colon bias levels that :ire much lower and/or above equilibrium. (ii) What determines the identity of the major colons? (iii) How do Shifts ill codon bias occur? (iv) What is the exact nature of selection oil colon bias? We discuss these questions in depth and offer some ideas on flow they can be addressed using a combination of computational and experimental analyses.},

  abstract = {Precise timing of flowering and maturation is critical for crop adaptation and productivity in specific environments. Soybean (Glycine max) is a facultative short-day plant and is highly sensitive to photoperiod, which limits the geographical range for cultivating specific soybean varieties. However, soybean cultivars overall have a wide range of geographical adaptation. Adaptation to different latitudes in soybean is controlled by maturity genes E1 to E11 and J, and quantitative trait loci (QTLs) including Time of Flowering 5 (Tof5), Tof11, Tof12, and Tof16. The interactions of these genes and QTLs allow soybean to adapt to different daylengths. Photoperiod sensitivity must be reduced to adapt to long-day conditions, while later flowering allows for higher yields under short-day conditions. This chapter provides an overview of recent research in photoperiodic flowering of soybean and discusses current challenges and future directions.},

Cultivated soybean was domesticated from wild soybean (Glycine soja) which both species are highly sensitive to photoperiod and can grow over a wide geographical range. The extensive ecological adaptation of wild and cultivated soybean has been facilitated by a series of genes represented as quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that control photoperiodic flowering and maturation. Here, we review the molecular and genetic basis underlying the regulation of photoperiodic flowering in soybean. Soybean has experienced both natural and artificial selection during adaptation to different latitudes, resulting in differential molecular and evolutionary mechanisms between wild and cultivated soybean. The in-depth study of natural and artificial selection for the photoperiodic adaptability of wild and cultivated soybean provides an important theoretical and practical basis for enhancing soybean adaptability and yield via molecular breeding. In addition, we discuss the possible origin of wild soybean, current challenges, and future research directions in this important topic.},

Genetic markers can be quickly identified by using next generation sequencing and assayed on a large number of materials using advanced technologies that can genotype tens of thousands of markers on thousands of individuals very rapidly. The ability to quickly identify and genotype genetic diversity is allowing researchers to identify beneficial genetic diversity and rapidly transfer it into elite cultivars for increased soybean production, biotic and abiotic protection, and improved seed quality.

  abstract = {Legume crops are relevant globally to the feeding and the nutrition of humans and animals because of their relatively high seed content of protein and essential amino acids. Additionally, they are related to sustainable agriculture, considering their ability to associate with atmospheric nitrogen fixing bacteria (Rhizobia). Despite this, several technical constraints of legumes crops have maintained their worldwide production far behind from cereals. This review article focuses in current information about recent advances in breeding and biotechnology of the major leguminous crops. Conventional breeding has mainly focused in improving multiple vegetative and reproductive traits that have associated to distinct heritability values, which reflects how amenable each character is for genetic improvement. Legumes have strongly entered into the genomics era through the complete genome sequencing of several species in the last decade. Moreover, a wealth of tools and techniques of Fabaceae genomics are now available and discussed throughout this article. In addition, there is an increasing amount of quantitative trait loci, candidate genes, and genes associated to abiotic and biotic resistance and to agronomic traits that have been reported, which will potentially allow more rapid progress of legume genetic improvement. Two successful examples of genetically modified legume crops are examined in this paper: glyphosate-resistant transgenic soybean and transgenic common bean resistant to Bean golden mosaic virus. Finally, legumes genomics and breeding programs, using classical breeding methods, marker-assisted selection, and biotechnological tools face a promising momentum for further application of technology and information that could boost their global production.},

  abstract = {Background With the migration of human beings, advances of agricultural sciences, evolution of planting patterns and global warming, soybeans have expanded to both tropical and high-latitude cold regions (HCRs). Unlike other regions, HCRs have much more significant and diverse photoperiods and temperature conditions over seasons or across latitudes, and HCR soybeans released there show rich diversity in maturity traits. However, HCR soybeans have not been as well classified into maturity groups (MGs) as other places. Therefore, it is necessary to identify MGs in HCRs and to genotype the maturity loci. Methods Local varieties were collected from the northern part of Northeast China and the far-eastern region of Russia. Maturity group reference (MGR) soybeans of MGs MG000, MG00, and MG0 were used as references during field experiments. Both local varieties and MGR soybeans were planted for two years (2010-2011) in Heihe (N 50\textdegree 15{${'}$}, E 127\textdegree 27{${'}$}, H 168.5 m), China. The days to VE (emergence), R1 (beginning bloom) and R7 (beginning maturity) were recorded and statistically analyzed. Furthermore, some varieties were further genotyped at four molecularly-identified maturity loci E1, E2, E3 and E4. Results The HCR varieties were classified into MG0 or even more early-maturing. In Heihe, some varieties matured much earlier than MG000, which is the most early-maturing known MG, and clustered into a separate group. We designated the group as MG0000, following the convention of MGs. HCR soybeans had relatively stable days to beginning bloom from emergence. The HCR varieties diversified into genotypes of E1, E2, E3 and E4. These loci had different effects on maturity. Conclusion HCRs diversify early-maturing MGs of soybean. MG0000, a new MG that matures much earlier than known MGs, was developed. HCR soybean breeding should focus more on shortening post-flowering reproductive growth. E1, E2, E3, and E4 function differentially.},

  abstract = {Both Europe and China have a low level of protein autonomy. They import 30\% and 60\%, respectively, of the world plant protein production for both human and animal nutrition. However, in both continents, regions with appropriate agro-ecological conditions for the production of plant proteins exist. The project EUCLEG, recently granted by the H2020 programme of European Union, has the ambition to give a new momentum to forage legume (alfalfa and red clover) and grain legume (pea, faba bean and soybean) breeding. The scientific objectives of this project are (i) to broaden the genetic base of legume crops, (ii) to analyse the genetic diversity of European and Chinese legume accessions using phenotypic traits (yield, quality in a context of climate change) and molecular markers, (iii) to analyse the genetic architecture of key breeding traits using association genetics (GWAS) and (iv) to evaluate the benefits brought by genomic selection (GS) to create new legume varieties. Comprehensive searchable databases containing passport data, as well as agronomic and genetic features will be developed. The breeders that are members of EUCLEG will exploit the results to create the new varieties needed to improve protein production.},

  abstract = {Soybean genome sequences were blasted with Arabidopsis thaliana regulatory genes involved in photoperiod-dependent flowering. This approach enabled the identification of 118 genes involved in the flowering pathway. Two genome sequences of cultivated (Williams 82) and wild (IT182932) soybeans were employed to survey functional DNA variations in the flowering-related homologs. Forty genes exhibiting nonsynonymous substitutions between G. max and G. soja were catalogued. In addition, 22 genes were found to co-localize with QTLs for six traits including flowering time, first flower, pod maturity, beginning of pod, reproductive period, and seed filling period. Among the genes overlapping the QTL regions, two LHY/CCA1 genes, GI and SFR6 contained amino acid changes. The recently duplicated sequence regions of the soybean genome were used as additional criteria for the speculation of the putative function of the homologs. Two duplicated regions showed redundancy of both flowering-related genes and QTLs. ID 12398025, which contains the homeologous regions between chr 7 and chr 16, was redundant for the LHY/CCA1 and SPA1 homologs and the QTLs. Retaining of the CRY1 gene and the pod maturity QTLs were observed in the duplicated region of ID 23546507 on chr 4 and chr 6. Functional DNA variation of the LHY/CCA1 gene (Glyma07g05410) was present in a counterpart of the duplicated region on chr 7, while the gene (Glyma16g01980) present in the other portion of the duplicated region on chr 16 did not show a functional sequence change. The gene list catalogued in this study provides primary insight for understanding the regulation of flowering time and maturity in soybean.},

In contrast to the current hypothesis of soybean domestication, which holds that the current cultivated soybean was domesticated from G. soja, our previous work has suggested that soybean was domesticated from the G. soja/G. max complex that diverged from a common ancestor of these two species of Glycine. In this review, many structural genomic differences between the two genomes are described and a total of 705 genes are identified as structural variations (SVs) between G. max and G. soja. After protein families database of alignments and hidden Markov models IDs and gene ontology terms were assigned, many interesting genes are discussed in detail using four domestication related traits, such as flowering time, transcriptional factors, carbon metabolism and disease resistance. Soybean domestication history is explored by studying these SVs in genes. Analysis of SVs in genes at the population-level may clarify the domestication history of soybean.},

This predominantly selfing species shows 7.1\% reduction of overall deleterious mutations in domesticated soybean relative to wild soybean and a~further 1.4\% reduction from landrace to improved accessions. The detected domestication-selective sweeps also show reduced levels of deleterious alleles. Importantly, genotype imputation with this resource increases the mapping resolution of genome-wide association studies for seed protein and oil traits in a soybean diversity panel., The accumulation of recombination events in selfing species may lead to a rapid fixation of both beneficial and deleterious mutations. Here, the authors resequence 781 soybean accessions, show purging of deleterious mutation during domestication, and report genome-wide associations for seed protein and oil traits.},

  abstract = {There is a considerable demand for crop improvement, especially considering the increasing growth of world population, continuing climatic fluctuations, and rapidly evolving plant pests and pathogens. Crop wild relatives hold great potential in providing beneficial alleles for crop improvement. Wild soybean, Glycine soja (Siebold \& Zucc.), the wild ancestor to the domesticated soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), harbors a high level of genetic variation. Research on G. soja has been largely devoted to understanding the domestication history of the soybean, while little effort has been made to explore its genetic diversity for crop improvement. High genomic diversity and expanded traits make G. soja populations an excellent source for soybean improvement. This review summarizes recent successful research examples of applying wild soybeans in dissecting the genetic basis of various traits, with a focus on abiotic/biotic stress tolerance and resistance. We also discuss the limitations of using G. soja. Perspective future research is proposed, including the application of advanced biotechnology and emerging genomic data to further utilize the wild soybean to counterbalance the rising demand for superior crops. We proposed there is an urgent need for international collaboration on germplasm collection, resource sharing, and conservation. We hope to use the wild soybean as an example to promote the exploration and use of wild resources for crop improvement in order to meet future food requirements.},

  abstract = {Background A number of different statistics are used for detecting natural selection using DNA sequencing data, including statistics that are summaries of the frequency spectrum, such as Tajima's D. These statistics are now often being applied in the analysis of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data. However, estimates of frequency spectra from NGS data are strongly affected by low sequencing coverage; the inherent technology dependent variation in sequencing depth causes systematic differences in the value of the statistic among genomic regions. Results We have developed an approach that accommodates the uncertainty of the data when calculating site frequency based neutrality test statistics. A salient feature of this approach is that it implicitly solves the problems of varying sequencing depth, missing data and avoids the need to infer variable sites for the analysis and thereby avoids ascertainment problems introduced by a SNP discovery process. Conclusion Using an empirical Bayes approach for fast computations, we show that this method produces results for low-coverage NGS data comparable to those achieved when the genotypes are known without uncertainty. We also validate the method in an analysis of data from the 1000 genomes project. The method is implemented in a fast framework which enables researchers to perform these neutrality tests on a genome-wide scale.},

  abstract = {High-throughput genomic sequencing allows to disentangle the evolutionary forces acting in populations. Among evolutionary forces, positive selection has received a lot of attention because it is related to the adaptation of populations in their environments, both biotic and abiotic. Positive selection, also known as Darwinian selection, occurs when an allele is favored by natural selection. The frequency of the favored allele increases in the population and, due to genetic hitchhiking, neighboring linked variation diminishes, creating so-called selective sweeps. Such a process leaves traces in genomes that can be detected in a future time point. Detecting traces of positive selection in genomes is achieved by searching for signatures introduced by selective sweeps, such as regions of reduced variation, a specific shift of the site frequency spectrum, and particular linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns in the region. A variety of approaches can be used for detecting selective sweeps, ranging from simple implementations that compute summary statistics to more advanced statistical approaches, e.g., Bayesian approaches, maximum-likelihood-based methods, and machine learning methods. In this chapter, we discuss selective sweep detection methodologies on the basis of their capacity to analyze whole genomes or just subgenomic regions, and on the specific polymorphism patterns they exploit as selective sweep signatures. We also summarize the results of comparisons among five open-source software releases (SweeD, SweepFinder, SweepFinder2, OmegaPlus, and RAiSD) regarding sensitivity, specificity, and execution times. Furthermore, we test and discuss machine learning methods and present a thorough performance analysis. In equilibrium neutral models or mild bottlenecks, most methods are able to detect selective sweeps accurately. Methods and tools that rely on linkage disequilibrium (LD) rather than single SNPs exhibit higher true positive rates than the site frequency spectrum (SFS)-based methods under the model of a single sweep or recurrent hitchhiking. However, their false positive rate is elevated when a misspecified demographic model is used to build the distribution of the statistic under the null hypothesis. Both LD and SFS-based approaches suffer from decreased accuracy on localizing the true target of selection in bottleneck scenarios. Furthermore, we present an extensive analysis of the effects of gene flow on selective sweep detection, a problem that has been understudied in selective sweep literature.},

In cultivated rice (Oryza sativa), crosses between high-yielding elite cultivars and low-yielding wild accessions often give rise to superior offspring, with wild alleles conferring increased performance in the context of the elite cultivar genetic background. Because the breeding value of wild germplasm cannot be determined by examining the performance of wild accessions, a phylogenetic approach is recommended to determine which interspecific combinations are most likely to be useful in a breeding program. As we deepen our understanding of how genetic diversity is partitioned within and between cultivated and wild gene pools of Oryza, breeders will have increased power to make predictions about the most efficient strategies for utilizing wild germplasm for rice improvement.},

In this large mega-environment (MEV) study, 75 European cultivars from five early maturity groups (MGs 000\textendash II) were evaluated for maturity-related traits at 22 locations in 10 countries across Europe. Clustering of the locations based on phenotypic similarity revealed six MEVs in latitudinal direction and suggested several more. Analysis of maturity identified several groups of cultivars with phenotypic similarity that are optimally adapted to the different growing regions in Europe. We identified several haplotypes for the allelic variants at the E1, E2, E3 and E4 genes, with each E haplotype comprising cultivars from different MGs. Cultivars with the same E haplotype can exhibit different flowering and maturity characteristics, suggesting that the genetic control of these traits is more complex and that adaptation involves additional genetic pathways, for example temperature requirement. Taken together, our study allowed the first unified assessment of soybean-growing regions in Europe and illustrates the strong effect of photoperiod on soybean adaptation and MEV classification, as well as the effects of the E maturity loci for soybean adaptation in Europe.},

The consequence of this founder effect is a narrow genetic variability in the crop population compared to its wild progenitor.

  abstract = {The recently acquired archaeological record for soybean from Japan, China and Korea is shedding light on the context in which this important economic plant became associated with people and was domesticated. This paper examines archaeological (charred) soybean seed size variation to determine what insight can be gained from a comprehensive comparison of 949 specimens from 22 sites. Seed length alone appears to represent seed size change through time, although the length\texttimes width\texttimes thickness product has the potential to provide better size change resolution. A widespread early association of small seeded soybean is as old as 9000\textendash 8600 cal BP in northern China and 7000 cal BP in Japan. Direct AMS radiocarbon dates on charred soybean seeds indicate selection resulted in large seed sizes in Japan by 5000 cal BP (Middle Jomon) and in Korea by 3000 cal BP (Early Mumun). Soybean seeds recovered in China from the Shang through Han periods are similar in length to the large Korean and Japanese specimens, but the overall size of the large Middle and Late Jomon, Early Mumun through Three Kingdom seeds is significantly larger than any of the Chinese specimens. The archaeological record appears to disconfirm the hypothesis of a single domestication of soybean and supports the view informed by recent phyologenetic research that soybean was domesticated in several locations in East Asia.},

  abstract = {Background As a photoperiod-sensitive and self-pollinated species, the growth periods traits play important roles in the adaptability and yield of soybean. To examine the genetic architecture of soybean growth periods, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a panel of 278 soybean accessions and 34,710 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with minor allele frequencies (MAF) higher than 0.04 detected by the specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) with a 6.14-fold average sequencing depth. GWAS was conducted by a compressed mixed linear model (CMLM) involving in both relative kinship and population structure. Results GWAS revealed that 37 significant SNP peaks associated with soybean flowering time or other growth periods related traits including full bloom, beginning pod, full pod, beginning seed, and full seed in two or more environments at -log10(P)\,{$>$}\,3.75 or -log10(P)\,{$>$}\,4.44 were distributed on 14 chromosomes, including chromosome 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19. Fourteen SNPs were novel loci and 23 SNPs were located within known QTLs or 75\,kb near the known SNPs. Five candidate genes (Glyma.05G101800, Glyma.11G140100, Glyma.11G142900, Glyma.19G099700, Glyma.19G100900) in a 90\,kb genomic region of each side of four significant SNPs (Gm5\_27111367, Gm11\_10629613, Gm11\_10950924, Gm19\_34768458) based on the average LD decay were homologs of Arabidopsis flowering time genes of AT5G48385.1, AT3G46510.1, AT5G59780.3, AT1G28050.1, and AT3G26790.1. These genes encoding FRI (FRIGIDA), PUB13 (plant U-box~13), MYB59, CONSTANS, and FUS3 proteins respectively might play important roles in controlling soybean growth periods. Conclusions This study identified putative SNP markers associated with soybean growth period traits, which could be used for the marker-assisted selection of soybean growth period traits. Furthermore, the possible candidate genes involved in the control of soybean flowering time were predicted.},

  abstract = {Agricultural production is greatly dependent on daylength, which is determined by latitude. Living organisms align their physiology to daylength through the circadian clock, which is made up of input sensors, core and peripheral clock components, and output. The light/dark cycle is the major input signal, moderated by temperature fluctuations and metabolic changes. The core clock in plants functions mainly through a number of transcription feedback loops. It is known that the circadian clock is not essential for survival. However, alterations in the clock components can lead to substantial changes in physiology. Thus, these clock components have become the de facto targets of artificial selection for crop improvement during domestication. Soybean was domesticated around 5,000 years ago. Although the circadian clock itself is not of particular interest to soybean breeders, specific alleles of the circadian clock components that affect agronomic traits, such as plant architecture, sensitivity to light/dark cycle, flowering time, maturation time, and yield, are. Consequently, compared to their wild relatives, cultivated soybeans have been bred to be more adaptive and productive at different latitudes and habitats for acreage expansion, even though the selection processes were made without any prior knowledge of the circadian clock. Now with the advances in comparative genomics, known modifications in the circadian clock component genes in cultivated soybean have been found, supporting the hypothesis that modifications of the clock are important for crop improvement. In this review, we will summarize the known modifications in soybean circadian clock components as a result of domestication and improvement. In addition to the well-studied effects on developmental timing, we will also discuss the potential of circadian clock modifications for improving other aspects of soybean productivity.},

  abstract = {Background and Aims Understanding the genetic basis underlying domestication-related traits (DRTs) is important in order to use wild germplasm efficiently for improving yield, stress tolerance and quality of crops. This study was conducted to characterize the genetic basis of DRTs in soybean (Glycine max) using quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. Methods A population of 96 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cultivated (ssp. max) x wild (ssp. soja) cross was used for mapping and QTL analysis. Nine DRTs were examined in 2004 and 2005. A linkage map was constructed with 282 markers by the Kosambi function, and the QTL was detected by composite interval mapping. Key Results The early flowering and determinate habit derived from the max parent were each controlled by one major QTL, corresponding to the major genes for maturity (e1) and determinate habit (dt1), respectively. There were only one or two significant QTLs for twinning habit, pod dehiscence, seed weight and hard seededness, which each accounted for approx. 20-50\% of the total variance. A comparison with the QTLs detected previously indicated that in pod dehiscence and hard seededness, at least one major QTL was common across different crosses, whereas no such consistent QTL existed for seed weight. Conclusions Most of the DRTs in soybeans were conditioned by one or two major QTLs and a number of genotype-dependent minor QTLs. The common major QTLs identified in pod dehiscence and hard seededness may have been key loci in the domestication of soybean. The evolutionary changes toward larger seed may have occurred through the accumulation of minor changes at many QTLs. Since the major QTLs for DRTs were scattered across only six of the 20 linkage groups, and since the QTLs were not clustered, introgression of useful genes from wild to cultivated soybeans can be carried out without large obstacles.},

  abstract = {Animal domestication and artificial selection give rise to gradual changes at the genomic level in populations. Subsequent footprints of selection, known as selection signatures or selective sweeps, have been traced in the genomes of many animal livestock species by exploiting variation in linkage disequilibrium patterns and/or reduction of genetic diversity. Domestication of most aquatic species is recent in comparison with land animals, and salmonids are one of the most important fish species in aquaculture. Coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), cultivated primarily in Chile, has been subjected to breeding programs to improve growth, disease resistance traits, and flesh color. This study aimed to identify selection signatures that may be involved in adaptation to culture conditions and traits of productive interest. To do so, individuals of two domestic populations cultured in Chile were genotyped with 200 thousand SNPs, and analyses were conducted using iHS, XP-EHH and CLR. Several signatures of selection on different chromosomal regions were detected across both populations. Some of the identified regions under selection contained genes such anapc2, alad, chp2 and myn, which have been previously associated with body weight in Atlantic salmon, or sec24d and robo1, which have been associated with resistance to Piscirickettsia salmonis in coho salmon. Findings in our study can contribute to an integrated genome-wide map of selection signatures, to help identify the genetic mechanisms of phenotypic diversity in coho salmon.},

  abstract = {``Genomic selection,'' the ability to select for even complex, quantitative traits based on marker data alone, has arisen from the conjunction of new high-throughput marker technologies and new statistical methods needed to analyze the data. This review surveys what is known about these technologies, with sections on population and quantitative genetic background, DNA marker development, statistical methods, reported accuracies of genomic selection (GS) predictions, prediction of nonadditive genetic effects, prediction in the presence of subpopulation structure, and impacts of GS on long-term gain. GS works by estimating the effects of many loci spread across the genome. Marker and observation numbers therefore need to scale with the genetic map length in Morgans and with the effective population size of the population under GS. For typical crops, the requirements range from at least 200 to at most 10,000 markers and observations. With that baseline, GS can greatly accelerate the breeding cycle while also using marker information to maintain genetic diversity and potentially prolong gain beyond what is possible with phenotypic selection. With the costs of marker technologies continuing to decline and the statistical methods becoming more routine, the results reviewed here suggest that GS will play a large role in the plant breeding of the future. Our summary and interpretation should prove useful to breeders as they assess the value of GS in the context of their populations and resources.},

History has numerous examples of both. The diversity of many crops have gone through domestication, dispersal and modernization bottlenecks. Between these major decreasing processes, diversity has picked up through different evolutionary processes, and plant breeding affected by policies. Major negative effects of plant breeding on diversity have been recorded following the modernization bottleneck, but alternative breeding strategies have come up as well, both in the formal system and in the interphase between formal and farmers' seed systems. Multiline breeding and participatory plant breeding are introduced as examples to also analyse effects of current developments in technology and policy. This paper intends to shed some light on the questions: how will current developments in technology and policy affect crop genetic diversity? Are we heading for a new bottleneck\textemdash either a molecular or a policy bottleneck, or a combination of both? Or could the future become more diverse? We look at the relationship between breeding, policies, and crop genetic diversity in farming systems with a birds-eye view.

  abstract = {Soybean is one of the most important crops worldwide. Brazil and the United States (US) are the world's two biggest producers of this legume. The increase of publicly available DNA sequencing data as well as high-density genotyping data of multiple soybean germplasms has made it possible to understand the genetic relationships and identify genomics regions that underwent selection pressure during soy domestication and breeding. In this study, we analyzed the genetic relationships between Brazilian (N\,=\,235) and US soybean cultivars (N\,=\,675) released in different decades and screened for genomic signatures between Brazilian and US cultivars. The population structure analysis demonstrated that the Brazilian germplasm has a narrower genetic base than the US germplasm. The US cultivars were grouped according to maturity groups, while Brazilian cultivars were separated according to decade of release. We found 73 SNPs that differentiate Brazilian and US soybean germplasm. Maturity-associated SNPs showed high allelic frequency differences between Brazilian and US accessions. Other important loci were identified separating cultivars released before and after 1996 in Brazil. Our data showed important genomic regions under selection during decades of soybean breeding in Brazil and the US that should be targeted to adapt lines from different origins in these countries.},

  abstract = {Among the several linkage disequilibrium measures known to capture different features of the non-independence between alleles at different loci, the most commonly used for diallelic loci is the r2 measure. In the present study, we tackled the problem of the bias of r2 estimate, which results from the sample structure and/or the relatedness between genotyped individuals. We derived two novel linkage disequilibrium measures for diallelic loci that are both extensions of the usual r2 measure. The first one, rS2, uses the population structure matrix, which consists of information about the origins of each individual and the admixture proportions of each individual genome. The second one, rV2, includes the kinship matrix into the calculation. These two corrections can be applied together in order to correct for both biases and are defined either on phased or unphased genotypes., We proved that these novel measures are linked to the power of association tests under the mixed linear model including structure and kinship corrections. We validated them on simulated data and applied them to real data sets collected on Vitis vinifera plants. Our results clearly showed the usefulness of the two corrected r2 measures, which actually captured `true' linkage disequilibrium unlike the usual r2 measure.},

  abstract = {Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, are already revolutionizing our understanding of genetic variation among individuals. However, the massive data sets generated by NGS\textemdash the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases\textemdash make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

However, they can be precipitated by a prolonged dialysis at pH 6 to give an actomyosin with a high, although variable, actin:myosin ratio. The sedimentation behavior of this actomyosin at high ionic strength was examined as a function of pH, protein concentration and composition by preparative ultracentrifugation. Comparisons with synthetic skeletal muscle actomyosins of similar composition demonstrated significant differences in the behaviors of these two systems. It was found that much smooth muscle actomyosin is not dissociated by normally relaxing conditions, and that it sediments at a slower rate than F-actin. The solubility of the supernatant protein (a myosin-enriched actomyosin) in 0.2 M K Cl (pH 7) depended on the pH during centrifugation. A lower solubility was associated only with a higher actin concentration in the supernatant, suggesting a dependence on actin repolymerization. Pure myosin was selectively precipitated from the supernatant by polyethylene glycol-6000, but only when the protein was soluble at low ionic strength. The solubility of purified myosin was similar to that of myosin from striated muscles. A relationship between the presence of depolymerized actin and the high solubility of smooth muscle contractile proteins is suggested.},

  abstract = {In many non-Asian countries, soy is consumed via soy-based meat and dairy alternatives, in addition to the traditional Asian soyfoods, such as tofu and miso. Meat alternatives are typically made using concentrated sources of soy protein, such as soy protein isolate (SPI) and soy protein concentrate (SPC). Therefore, these products are classified as ultra-processed foods (UPFs; group 4) according to NOVA, an increasingly widely used food-classification system that classifies all foods into 1 of 4 groups according to the processing they undergo. Furthermore, most soymilks, even those made from whole soybeans, are also classified as UPFs because of the addition of sugars and emulsifiers. Increasingly, recommendations are being made to restrict the consumption of UPFs because their intake is associated with a variety of adverse health outcomes. Critics of UPFs argue these foods are unhealthful for a wide assortment of reasons. Explanations for the proposed adverse effects of UPFs include their high energy density, high glycemic index (GI), hyper-palatability, and low satiety potential. Claims have also been made that UPFs are not sustainably produced. However, this perspective argues that none of the criticisms of UPFs apply to soy-based meat and dairy alternatives when compared with their animal-based counterparts, beef and cow milk, which are classified as unprocessed or minimally processed foods (group 1). Classifying soy-based meat and dairy alternatives as UPFs may hinder their public acceptance, which could detrimentally affect personal and planetary health. In conclusion, the NOVA classification system is simplistic and does not adequately evaluate the nutritional attributes of meat and dairy alternatives based on soy.},

  abstract = {Data on DNA polymorphisms detected by restriction endonucleases are rapidly accumulating. With the aim of analyzing these data, several different measures of nucleon (DNA segment) diversity within and between populations are proposed, and statistical methods for estimating these quantities are developed. These statistical methods are applicable to both nuclear and non-nuclear DNAs. When evolutionary change of nucleons occurs mainly by mutation and genetic drift, all the measures can be expressed in terms of the product of mutation rate per nucleon and effective population size. A method for estimating nucleotide diversity from nucleon diversity is also presented under certain assumptions. It is shown that DNA divergence between two populations can be studied either by the average number of restriction site differences or by the average number of nucleotide differences. In either case, a large number of different restriction enzymes should be used for studying phylogenetic relationships among related organisms, since the effect of stochastic factors on these quantities is very large. The statistical methods developed have been applied to data of Shah and Langley on mitochondrial (mt)DNA from Drosophila melanogaster, simulans and virilis. This application has suggested that the evolutionary change of mtDNA in higher animals occurs mainly by nucleotide substitution rather than by deletion and insertion. The evolutionary distances among the three species have also been estimated.},

Small examples are used to illustrate the basics and published data are used as case studies. Readers are expected to have a basic knowledge of biology, genetics, and statistical inference methods. Graduate students and post-doctorate researchers will find resources to analyze their population genetic and genomic data as well as help them design new studies. The first four chapters review the basics of population genomics, data acquisition, and the use of R to store and manipulate genomic data. Chapter 5 treats the exploration of genomic data, an important issue when analysing large data sets. The other five chapters cover linkage disequilibrium, population genomic structure, geographical structure, past demographic events, and natural selection. These chapters include supervised and unsupervised methods, admixture analysis, an in-depth treatment of multivariate methods, and advice on how to handle GIS data. The analysis of natural selection, a traditional issue in evolutionary biology, has known a revival with modern population genomic data. All chapters include exercises.

However, its ability to predict phenotypic values from molecular data is less well studied. Here, we describe the theoretical foundations of DL and provide a generic code that can be easily modified to suit specific needs. DL comprises a wide variety of algorithms which depend on numerous hyperparameters. Careful optimization of hyperparameter values is critical to avoid overfitting. Among the DL architectures currently tested in genomic prediction, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) seem more promising than multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). A limitation of DL is in interpreting the results. This may not be relevant for genomic prediction in plant or animal breeding but can be critical when deciding the genetic risk to a disease. Although DL technologies are not ``plug-and-play'', they are easily implemented using Keras and TensorFlow public software. To illustrate the principles described here, we implemented a Keras-based code in GitHub.},

  abstract = {Although many computer programs can perform population genetics calculations, they are typically limited in the analyses and data input formats they offer; few applications can process the large data sets produced by whole-genome resequencing projects. Furthermore, there is no coherent framework for the easy integration of new statistics into existing pipelines, hindering the development and application of new population genetics and genomics approaches. Here, we present PopGenome, a population genomics package for the R software environment (a de facto standard for statistical analyses). PopGenome can efficiently process genome-scale data as well as large sets of individual loci. It reads DNA alignments and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data sets in most common formats, including those used by the HapMap, 1000 human genomes, and 1001 Arabidopsis genomes projects. PopGenome also reads associated annotation files in GFF format, enabling users to easily define regions or classify SNPs based on their annotation; all analyses can also be applied to sliding windows. PopGenome offers a wide range of diverse population genetics analyses, including neutrality tests as well as statistics for population differentiation, linkage disequilibrium, and recombination. PopGenome is linked to Hudson's MS and Ewing's MSMS programs to assess statistical significance based on coalescent simulations. PopGenome's integration in R facilitates effortless and reproducible downstream analyses as well as the production of publication-quality graphics. Developers can easily incorporate new analyses methods into the PopGenome framework.

Several studies report significant LD over distances longer than those predicted by standard models, whereas some data from short, intergenic regions show less LD than would be expected. The apparent discrepancies between theory and data present a challenge\textemdash both to modelers and to human geneticists\textemdash to identify which important features are missing from our understanding of the biological processes that give rise to LD. Salient features may include demographic complications such as recent admixture, as well as genetic factors such as local variation in recombination rates, gene conversion, and the potential segregation of inversions. We also outline some implications that the emerging patterns of LD have for association-mapping strategies. In particular, we discuss what marker densities might be necessary for genomewide association scans.},

  abstract = {Soybean is an important crop not only for human consumption but also for its addition of nitrogen to the soil during crop rotation. China has the largest collection of cultivated soybeans (Glycine max) and wild soybeans (Glycine soja) all over the world. The platform of soybean core, mini core and integrated applied core collections has been developed in the past decade based on systematic researches which included the sampling strategies, statistical methods, phenotypic data and SSR markers. Meanwhile, intergrated applied core collections including accessions with single or integrated favorite traits are being developed in order to meet the demand of soybean breeding. These kinds of core collections provide powerful materials for evaluation of germplasm, identification of trait-specific accessions, gene discovery, allele mining, genomic study, maker development, and molecular breeding. Some successful cases have proved the usefulness and efficiency of this platform. The platform is helpful for enhancing utilization of soybean genetic resources in sustainable crop improvement for food security. The efficient utilization of this platform in the future is relying on accurate phenotyping methods, abundant functional markers, high-throughput genotyping platforms, and effective breeding programs.},

  abstract = {Targeted and untargeted selections including domestication and breeding efforts can reduce genetic diversity in breeding germplasm and create selective sweeps in crop genomes. The genomic regions at which selective sweeps are detected can reveal important information about signatures of selection. We have analyzed the genetic diversity within a soybean germplasm collection relevant for breeding in Europe (the EUCLEG collection), and have identified selective sweeps through a genome-wide scan comparing that collection to Chinese soybean collections. This work involved genotyping of 480 EUCLEG soybean accessions, including 210 improved varieties, 216 breeding lines and 54 landraces using the 355K SoySNP microarray. SNP calling of 477 EUCLEG accessions together with 328 Chinese soybean accessions identified 224,993 high-quality SNP markers. Population structure analysis revealed a clear differentiation between the EUCLEG collection and the Chinese materials. Further, the EUCLEG collection was sub-structured into five subgroups that were differentiated by geographical origin. No clear association between subgroups and maturity group was detected. The genetic diversity was lower in the EUCLEG collection compared to the Chinese collections. Selective sweep analysis revealed 23 selective sweep regions distributed over 12 chromosomes. Co-localization of these selective sweep regions with previously reported QTLs and genes revealed that various signatures of selection in the EUCLEG collection may be related to domestication and improvement traits including seed protein and oil content, phenology, nitrogen fixation, yield components, diseases resistance and quality. No signatures of selection related to stem determinacy were detected. In addition, absence of signatures of selection for a substantial number of QTLs related to yield, protein content, oil content and phenological traits suggests the presence of substantial genetic diversity in the EUCLEG collection. Taken together, the results obtained demonstrate that the available genetic diversity in the EUCLEG collection can be further exploited for research and breeding purposes. However, incorporation of exotic material can be considered to broaden its genetic base.},

  abstract = {Datasets of hundreds or thousands of SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) from multiple individuals per species are increasingly used to study population structure, species delimitation and shallow phylogenetics. The principal software tool to infer species or population trees from SNP data is currently the BEAST template SNAPP which uses a Bayesian coalescent analysis. However, it is computationally extremely demanding and tolerates only small amounts of missing data. We used simulated and empirical SNPs from plants (Australian Craspedia, Asteraceae, and Pelargonium, Geraniaceae) to compare species trees produced (1) by SNAPP, (2) using SVD quartets, and (3) using Bayesian and parsimony analysis with several different approaches to summarising data from multiple samples into one set of traits per species. Our aims were to explore the impact of tree topology and missing data on the results, and to test which data summarising and analyses approaches would best approximate the results obtained from SNAPP for empirical data. SVD quartets retrieved the correct topology from simulated data, as did SNAPP except in the case of a very unbalanced phylogeny. Both methods failed to retrieve the correct topology when large amounts of data were missing. Bayesian analysis of species level summary data scoring the two alleles of each SNP as independent characters and parsimony analysis of data scoring each SNP as one character produced trees with branch length distributions closest to the true trees on which SNPs were simulated. For empirical data, Bayesian inference and Dollo parsimony analysis of data scored allele-wise produced phylogenies most congruent with the results of SNAPP. In the case of study groups divergent enough for missing data to be phylogenetically informative (because of additional mutations preventing amplification of genomic fragments or bioinformatic establishment of homology), scoring of SNP data as a presence/absence matrix irrespective of allele content might be an additional option. As this depends on sampling across species being reasonably even and a random distribution of non-informative instances of missing data, however, further exploration of this approach is needed. Properly chosen data summary approaches to inferring species trees from SNP data may represent a potential alternative to currently available individual-level coalescent analyses especially for quick data exploration and when dealing with computationally demanding or patchy datasets.},

  abstract = {Soybean (Glycine max) is one of the most important crop plants for seed protein and oil content, and for its capacity to fix atmospheric nitrogen through symbioses with soil-borne microorganisms. We sequenced the 1.1-gigabase genome by a whole-genome shotgun approach and integrated it with physical and high-density genetic maps to create a chromosome-scale draft sequence assembly. We predict 46,430 protein-coding genes, 70\% more than Arabidopsis and similar to the poplar genome which, like soybean, is an ancient polyploid (palaeopolyploid). About 78\% of the predicted genes occur in chromosome ends, which comprise less than one-half of the genome but account for nearly all of the genetic recombination. Genome duplications occurred at approximately 59 and 13 million years ago, resulting in a highly duplicated genome with nearly 75\% of the genes present in multiple copies. The two duplication events were followed by gene diversification and loss, and numerous chromosome rearrangements. An accurate soybean genome sequence will facilitate the identification of the genetic basis of many soybean traits, and accelerate the creation of improved soybean varieties.},

However, there is still no universal standard or quantifiable methodology for MG classification. In this study, phenological traits of 107 Chinese, 4 Far East Russian representative soybean varieties, and 113 North American reference varieties covering 13 MGs were evaluated at eight locations (ranging from 30 to 50\textdegree{} N) in four ecoregions of China for two consecutive years (2014 and 2015). Relative maturity groups (RMGs) were attributed to all the varieties based on the linear regression models. To decimalize the RMG values of the early-maturing varieties belonging to MGs below 0, negative values were defined for MGs 00, 000, and 0000. The additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI) model was used to screen 185 standard candidate varieties for MGs 0000 to VIII. This study provided a systematic and quantifiable methodology for RMG identification in soybeans. The methodology is expected to be widely adopted by soybean regionalization and germplasm exchanges throughout the world and will be helpful for characterizing the photothermal sensitivity and adaptability of the given soybean varieties.},

  abstract = {The year 2018 marks 100 years since the concept of linkage disequilibrium (LD) was introduced, and 50 years since the importance of chance segregation in generating LD was recognized. GenomeWide Association Studies (GWAS) now use...One hundred years ago, the first population genetic calculations were made for two loci. They indicated that populations should settle down to a state where the frequency of an allele at one locus is independent of the frequency of an allele at a second locus, even if these loci are linked. Fifty years later it was realized what is obvious in retrospect, that these calculations ignored the effect of chance segregation of linked loci, an effect now widely recognized following the association of closely linked markers (SNPs) with rare genetic diseases. Linkage disequilibrium is now accepted as the norm for closely linked loci, leading to powerful applications in the mapping of disease alleles and quantitative trait loci, in the detection of sites of selection in the human genome, in the application of genomic prediction of quantitative traits in animal and plant breeding, in the estimation of population size, and in the dating of population divergence.},

It is found that the correlation between these two estimates is large when the sample size is small, and decreases slowly as the sample size increases. Using the relationship obtained, a statistical method for testing the neutral mutation hypothesis is developed. This method needs only the data of DNA polymorphism, namely the genetic variation within population at the DNA level. A simple method of computer simulation, that was used in order to obtain the distribution of a new statistic developed, is also presented. Applying this statistical method to the five regions of DNA sequences in Drosophila melanogaster, it is found that large insertion/deletion (greater than 100 bp) is deleterious. It is suggested that the natural selection against large insertion/deletion is so weak that a large amount of variation is maintained in a population.},

  abstract = {Effective population size (Ne) determines the amount of genetic variation, genetic drift, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) in populations. Here, we present the first genome-wide estimates of human effective population size from LD data. Chromosome-specific effective population size was estimated for all autosomes and the X chromosome from estimated LD between SNP pairs {$<$}100 kb apart. We account for variation in recombination rate by using coalescent-based estimates of fine-scale recombination rate from one sample and correlating these with LD in an independent sample. Phase I of the HapMap project produced between 18 and 22 million SNP pairs in samples from four populations: Yoruba from Ibadan (YRI), Nigeria; Japanese from Tokyo (JPT); Han Chinese from Beijing (HCB); and residents from Utah with ancestry from northern and western Europe (CEU). For CEU, JPT, and HCB, the estimate of effective population size, adjusted for SNP ascertainment bias, was {$\sim$}3100, whereas the estimate for the YRI was {$\sim$}7500, consistent with the out-of-Africa theory of ancestral human population expansion and concurrent bottlenecks. We show that the decay in LD over distance between SNPs is consistent with recent population growth. The estimates of Ne are lower than previously published estimates based on heterozygosity, possibly because they represent one or more bottlenecks in human population size that occurred {$\sim$}10,000 to 200,000 years ago.},

  abstract = {Photoperiodic genes in soybean affect latitudinal adaptation, plant growth, and overall productivity of the crop. Soybean adapts to large latitudinal zones from 50\textdegree N to 40\textdegree S, but its individual accessions adapt to a very narrow latitudinal band. For its worldwide production, major considerations are its photoperiodic and growth habit genes. Inheritance of the photoperiodic genes and role of these genes regulate early or late flowering and also regulate early or late maturity of the crop. In this chapter, we have summarized the photoperiodic and growth habit genes and their role in soybean flowering and maturity. We have also discussed their mapping, mechanism, quantitative trait loci (QTL) study, and linked markers. Major photoperiodic genes include E1 gene, E2 gene, E3 gene, E4 gene, E5 gene, E7 gene, E8 gene, and E10 gene, and genes responsible for growth habit, Dt1 and Dt2, interact with each other and are involved in the functions of flowering, maturity, and plant architecture. Specific combinations of these genes have been found to confer adaptation to specific zones of the world. Therefore, such study will be useful in the development of varieties adapted in adverse conditions of photoperiod in different zones of the country. Plant photoperiodic response provides the synchronization of their growth pattern with the seasonal events and, therefore, their better adaptation. At the same time, high photoperiodic sensitivity can retard the dispersal of important agricultural crops. These problems are solved with various breeding strategies.},

  abstract = {Cold stress is a major factor influencing the geographical distribution of soybean growth and causes immense losses in productivity. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that the soybean has undergone to survive cold temperatures will have immense value in improving soybean cold tolerance. This review focuses on the molecular mechanisms involved in soybean response to cold. We summarized the recent studies on soybean cold-tolerant quantitative trait loci (QTLs), transcription factors, associated cold-regulated (COR) genes, and the regulatory pathways in response to cold stress. Cold-tolerant QTLs were found to be overlapped with the genomic region of maturity loci of E1, E3, E4, pubescence color locus of T, stem growth habit gene locus of Dt1, and leaf shape locus of Ln, indicating that pleiotropic loci may control multiple traits, including cold tolerance. The C-repeat responsive element binding factors (CBFs) are evolutionarily conserved across species. The expression of most GmDREB1s was upregulated by cold stress and overexpression of GmDREB1B;1 in soybean protoplast, and transgenic Arabidopsis plants can increase the expression of genes with the DRE core motif in their promoter regions under cold stress. Other soybean cold-responsive regulators, such as GmMYBJ1, GmNEK1, GmZF1, GmbZIP, GmTCF1a,~SCOF-1 and so on, enhance cold tolerance by regulating the expression of COR genes in transgenic Arabidopsis. CBF-dependent and CBF-independent pathways are cross-talking and work together to activate cold stress gene expression. Even though it requires further dissection for precise understanding, the function of soybean cold-responsive transcription factors and associated COR genes studied in Arabidopsis shed light on the molecular mechanism of cold responses in soybeans and other crops. Furthermore, the findings may also provide practical applications for breeding cold-tolerant soybean varieties in high-latitude and high-altitude regions.},

  abstract = {Crop domestication is a good example of plant\textendash human co-evolution. Seed gathering and human cultivation of crops were observed since the Neolithic period, as shown by archeological evidence. Numerous studies have been conducted to identify genes related to domestication. With the development of molecular techniques (molecular markers and next-generation sequencing) and bioinformatics, a greater understanding of crop domestication and improvement has been established, including the origins of crops, the numbers of independent domestication events, the molecular diversity of domestication-related traits (DRTs), and the selection pressures. A comparison of the genome sequences between wild species and cultivated crops may provide key information regarding the genetic elements involved in speciation and domestication. Therefore, sequencing projects of currently important crops and their wild relatives are in progress. Accordingly, whole genome sequencing of soybean could provide new knowledge about domestication of this important crop. In this review, we introduce the archaeological evidence of soybean domestication and summarize the DRTs in soybean populations of crosses between cultivated (Glycine max) and wild soybean (G. soja). Soybean domestication is discussed at the sequence level. The current hypothesis of soybean domestication considers that G. max was domesticated from G. soja. However, our previous work suggested that soybean was domesticated from the G. soja/G. max complex that diverged from a common ancestor of these two species of Glycine. This review explores soybean domestication history by focusing on nucleotide diversity using resequencing. Analysis of genes around DRTs at the population level may clarify the domestication history of soybean.},

Their findings confirm known maturity loci and reveal new candidate genes and alleles as well as environmental interactions of individual quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for flowering and maturity time.

FISH mapping of seven putatively gene-rich BACs from linkage group L (chromosome 19) revealed that most of the genetic map correlates to the highly euchromatic long arm and that there is extensive homeology with another chromosome pair, although colinearity of some loci does appear to be disrupted. Moreover, mapping of BACs containing high-copy sequences revealed sequestration of high-copy repeats to the pericentromeric regions of this chromosome.

  abstract = {Genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) in livestock and polygenic risk scores (PRS) in humans are conceptually similar; however, the between-species differences in linkage disequilibrium (LD) provide a fundamental point of distinction that impacts approaches to data analyses...In this Review, we focus on the similarity of the concepts underlying prediction of estimated breeding values (EBVs) in livestock and polygenic risk scores (PRS) in humans. Our research spans both fields and so we recognize factors that are very obvious for those in one field, but less so for those in the other. Differences in family size between species is the wedge that drives the different viewpoints and approaches. Large family size achievable in nonhuman species accompanied by selection generates a smaller effective population size, increased linkage disequilibrium and a higher average genetic relationship between individuals within a population. In human genetic analyses, we select individuals unrelated in the classical sense (coefficient of relationship \&lt;0.05) to estimate heritability captured by common SNPs. In livestock data, all animals within a breed are to some extent ``related,'' and so it is not possible to select unrelated individuals and retain a data set of sufficient size to analyze. These differences directly or indirectly impact the way data analyses are undertaken. In livestock, genetic segregation variance exposed through samplings of parental genomes within families is directly observable and taken for granted. In humans, this genomic variation is under-recognized for its contribution to variation in polygenic risk of common disease, in both those with and without family history of disease. We explore the equation that predicts the expected proportion of variance explained using PRS, and quantify how GWAS sample size is the key factor for maximizing accuracy of prediction in both humans and livestock. Last, we bring together the concepts discussed to address some frequently asked questions.},

  abstract = {This study is the first assessment of the entire soybean [Glycine max (L.) Men] collection of the United State Department of Agriculture National Plant Germplasm System (USDA) reporting quantitative and population genomic parameters. It also provides a new insight into soybean germplasm structure. Germplasm studies enable plant breeders to incorporate novel genetic resources into breeding pipelines to improve valuable agronomic traits. We conducted comprehensive analyses on the 19,652 soybean accessions in the USDA-ARS germplasm collection, genotyped with the SoySNP50 K iSelect BeadChip SNP array, to elucidate the quantitative properties of existing subpopulations inferred through hierarchical clustering performed with Ward's D agglomeration method and Nei's standard genetic distance. We found the effective population size to be approximately 106 individuals based on the linkage disequilibrium of unlinked loci. The cladogram indicated the existence of eight major clusters. Each cluster displays particular properties with regard to major quantitative traits. Among those, cluster 3 represents the tropical and semi-tropical genetic material, cluster 5 displays large seeds and may represent food-grade germplasm, and cluster 7 represents the undomesticated material in the germplasm collection. The average F-ST among clusters was 0.22 and a total of 914 SNPs were exclusive to specific clusters. Our classification and characterization of the germplasm collection into major clusters provides valuable information about the genetic resources available to soybean breeders and researchers.},

  abstract = {Soybean (Glycine max) is a facultative short-day plant with a sensitive photoperiod perception and reaction system, which allows it to adjust its physiological state and gene regulatory networks to seasonal and diurnal changes in environmental conditions. In the past few decades, soybean cultivation has spread from East Asia to areas throughout the world. Biologists and breeders must now confront the challenge of understanding the molecular mechanism of soybean photoperiodism and improving agronomic traits to enable this important crop to adapt to geographical and environmental changes. In this review, we summarize the genetic regulatory network underlying photoperiodic responses in soybean. Genomic and genetic studies have revealed that the circadian clock, in conjunction with the light perception pathways, regulates photoperiodic flowering. Here, we provide an annotated list of 844 candidate flowering genes in soybean, with their putative biological functions. Many photoperiod-related genes have been intensively selected during domestication and crop improvement. Finally, we describe recent progress in engineering photoperiod-responsive genes for improving agronomic traits to enhance geographic adaptation in soybean, as well as future prospects for research on soybean photoperiodic responses.},

This characteristic severely limits the cultivation range of a given soybean cultivar and affects the performances of agronomic traits such as yield, plant architectures, and seed quality. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of photo-thermal sensitivity will provide a theoretical basis for soybean improvement. In this review, we introduce the advances in physiological, genetic, and molecular researches in photoperiodism of soybean, and progress in the improvement of the photo-thermal adaptability. We also summarize the photo-thermal conditions and characteristics of widely-planted soybean cultivars of major production regions in China. Furthermore, we proposed a novel concept of `ecotyping' and the strategies for widely-adapted soybean cultivar breeding. This review provides an important guide for improving the adaptability of soybean.},

In this study, we developed a large diversity panel consisting of 1503 early-maturing soybean lines and used genome-wide association mapping to dissect the genetic architecture underlying two crucial adaptation traits, flowering time and maturity. This revealed several known maturity loci, E1, E2, E3, and E4, and the growth habit locus Dt2 as causal candidate loci, and also a novel putative causal locus, GmFRL1, encoding a homolog of the vernalization pathway gene FRIGIDA-like 1. In addition, the scan for quantitative trait locus (QTL)-by-environment interactions identified GmAPETALA1d as a candidate gene for a QTL with environment-dependent reversed allelic effects. The polymorphisms of these candidate genes were identified using whole-genome resequencing data of 338 soybeans, which also revealed a novel E4 variant, e4-par, carried by 11 lines, with nine of them originating from Central Europe. Collectively, our results illustrate how combinations of QTL and their interactions with the environment facilitate the photothermal adaptation of soybean to regions far beyond its center of origin.},

  abstract = {To address domestication and improvement studies of soybean seed size- and oil-related traits, a series of domesticated and improved regions, loci, and candidate genes were identified in 286 soybean accessions using domestication and improvement analyses, genome-wide association studies, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and bulked segregant analyses in this study. As a result, 534 candidate domestication regions (CDRs) and 458 candidate improvement regions (CIRs) were identified in this study and integrated with those in five and three previous studies, respectively, to obtain 952 CDRs and 538 CIRs; 1469 loci for soybean seed size- and oil-related traits were identified in this study and integrated with those in Soybase to obtain 433 QTL clusters. The two results were intersected to obtain 245 domestication and 221 improvement loci for the above traits. Around these trait-related domestication and improvement loci, 7 domestication and 7 improvement genes were found to be truly associated with these traits, and 372 candidate domestication and 87 candidate improvement genes were identified using gene expression, SNP variants in genome, miRNA binding, KEGG pathway, DNA methylation, and haplotype analysis. These genes were used to explain the trait changes in domestication and improvement. As a result, the trait changes can be explained by their frequencies of elite haplotypes, base mutations in coding region, and three factors affecting their expression levels. In addition, 56 domestication and 15 improvement genes may be valuable for future soybean breeding. This study can provide useful gene resources for future soybean breeding and molecular biology research.},
